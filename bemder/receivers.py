class Receiver():
    '''
    A receiver class to initialize the following receiver properties:
    cood - 3D coordinates of a receiver (p, u or pu)
    There are several types of receivers to be implemented.
    - single_rec: is a single receiver (this is the class __init__)
    - double_rec: is a pair of receivers (tipically used in impedance measurements - separated by a z distance)
    - line_array: an line trough z containing receivers
    - planar_array: a regular grid of microphones
    - double_planar_array: a double regular grid of microphones separated by a z distance
    - spherical_array: a sphere of receivers
    - arc: an arc of receivers
